# restful_resource (Data Source)

`restful_resource` data source can be used to retrieve the model of a restful resource by ID.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "restful_resource" "test" {
  id = "/posts/1"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of the Resource, i.e. The path of the data source, relative to the `base_url` of the provider.

### Optional

- `header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `header` set in the provider block.
- `precheck` (Attributes) The precheck that is prior to the "Read" operation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--precheck))
- `query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `query` set in the provider block.
- `selector` (String) A selector in [gjson query syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md#queries), that is used when `id` represents a collection of resources, to select exactly one member resource of from it

### Read-Only

- `output` (String) The response body after reading the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--precheck"></a>
### Nested Schema for `precheck`

Required:

- `status` (Attributes) The expected status sentinels for each polling state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--precheck--status))
- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `scope.path`, where `scope` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `path` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second.
- `path` (String) The path used to query readiness, relative to the `base_url` of the provider. By default, the `id` of this resource is used.
- `query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters.

<a id="nestedatt--precheck--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `precheck.status`

Required:

- `success` (String) The expected status sentinel for suceess status.

Optional:

- `pending` (List of String) The expected status sentinels for pending status.
