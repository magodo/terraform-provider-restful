# restful_operation (Resource)

`restful_operation` represents a one-time API call operation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "restful_operation" "register_rp" {
  path = format("/subscriptions/%s/providers/Microsoft.ProviderHub/register", var.subscription_id)
  query = {
    api-version = ["2014-04-01-preview"]
  }
  method = "POST"
  poll = {
    url_locator    = format("exact./subscriptions/%s/providers/Microsoft.ProviderHub?api-version=2014-04-01-preview", var.subscription_id)
    status_locator = "body.registrationState"
    status = {
      success = "Registered"
      pending = ["Registering"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `method` (String) The HTTP method for the `Create`/`Update` call. Possible values are `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.
- `path` (String) The path for the `Create`/`Update` call, relative to the `base_url` of the provider.

### Optional

- `body` (Dynamic) The payload for the `Create`/`Update` call.
- `delete_body` (Dynamic) The payload for the `Delete` call.
- `delete_header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each delete request. This overrides the `header` set in the resource block.
- `delete_method` (String) The method for the `Delete` call. Possible values are `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`. If this is not specified, no `Delete` call will occur.
- `delete_path` (String) The path for the `Delete` call, relative to the `base_url` of the provider. The `path` is used instead if `delete_path` is absent.
- `delete_query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each delete request. This overrides the `query` set in the resource block.
- `ephemeral_body` (Dynamic) The ephemeral (write-only) properties of the resource. This will be merge-patched to the `body` to construct the actual request body.
- `header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `header` set in the provider block.
- `id_builder` (String) The pattern used to build the `id`. The `path` is used as the `id` instead if absent.This can be a string literal, or combined by following params: path param: `$(path)` expanded to `path`, body param: `$(body.x.y.z)` expands to the `x.y.z` property of the API body. Especially for the body param, it can add a chain of functions (applied from left to right), in the form of `$f1.f2(body)`. Supported functions include: `escape` (URL path escape, by default applied), `unescape` (URL path unescape), `query_escape` (URL query escape), `query_unescape` (URL query unescape), `base` (filepath base), `url_path` (path segment of a URL), `trim_path` (trim `path`).
- `operation_header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each operation request. This overrides the `header` set in the resource block.
- `operation_query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each operation request. This overrides the `query` set in the resource block.
- `output_attrs` (Set of String) A set of `output` attribute paths (in [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md)) that will be exported in the `output`. If this is not specified, all attributes will be exported by `output`.
- `poll` (Attributes) The polling option for the "`Create`/`Update`" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll))
- `poll_delete` (Attributes) The polling option for the "`Delete`" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_delete))
- `precheck` (Attributes List) An array of prechecks that need to pass prior to the "`Create`/`Update`" operation. Exactly one of `mutex` or `api` should be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--precheck))
- `precheck_delete` (Attributes List) An array of prechecks that need to pass prior to the "`Delete`" operation. Exactly one of `mutex` or `api` should be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--precheck_delete))
- `query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `query` set in the provider block.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the operation.
- `output` (Dynamic) The response body. If `ephemeral_body` get returned by API, it will be removed from `output`.

<a id="nestedatt--poll"></a>
### Nested Schema for `poll`

Required:

- `status` (Attributes) The expected status sentinels for each polling state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll--status))
- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `scope.path`, where `scope` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `path` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md). The `path` can contain `$(body.x.y.z)` parameter that reference property from either the response body (for `Create`, after selector), or `state.output` (for `Read`/`Update`/`Delete`).

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second. Defaults to `10`.
- `header` (Map of String) The header parameters. This overrides the `header` set in the resource block.
- `url_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the polling url. The format can be one of `header.path` (use the property at `path` in response header), `body.path` (use the property at `path` in response body) or `exact.value` (use the exact `value`). When absent, the current operation's URL is used for polling, execpt `Create` where it fallbacks to use the path constructed by the `read_path` as the polling URL.
