# restful_resource (Resource)

`restful_resource` manages a restful resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "restful_resource" "rg" {
  path = format("/subscriptions/%s/resourceGroups/%s", var.subscription_id, "example")
  query = {
    api-version = ["2020-06-01"]
  }
  create_method = "PUT"
  poll_delete = {
    status_locator = "code"
    status = {
      success = "404"
      pending = ["202", "200"]
    }
  }
  body = jsonencode({
    location = "westus"
    tags = {
      foo = "bar"
    }
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `body` (String) The properties of the resource.
- `path` (String) The path of the resource, relative to the `base_url` of the provider. It differs when `create_method` is `PUT` and `POST`.

### Optional

- `create_method` (String) The method used to create the resource. Possible values are `PUT` and `POST`. This overrides the `create_method` set in the provider block (defaults to POST).
- `header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `header` set in the provider block.
- `merge_patch_disabled` (Boolean) Whether to use a JSON Merge Patch as the request body in the PATCH update? This is only effective when `update_method` is set to `PATCH`. This overrides the `merge_patch_disabled` set in the provider block (defaults to `false`).
- `name_path` (String) The path (in [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md)) to the name attribute in the response, which is only used during creation of the resource to construct the resource identifier. This is ignored when `create_method` is `PUT`. Either `name_path` or `url_path` needs to set when `create_method` is `POST`.
- `poll_create` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Create" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_create))
- `poll_delete` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Delete" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_delete))
- `poll_update` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Update" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_update))
- `query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `query` set in the provider block.
- `update_method` (String) The method used to update the resource. Possible values are `PUT` and `PATCH`. This overrides the `update_method` set in the provider block (defaults to PUT).
- `update_path` (String) The path used to update the resource, relative to the `base_url` of the provider. It differs when `create_method` is `PUT` (represents the full path) and `POST` (represents the base path with out the last name segment).
- `url_path` (String) The path (in [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md)) to the id attribute in the response, which is only used during creation of the resource to be as the resource identifier. This is ignored when `create_method` is `PUT`. Either `name_path` or `url_path` needs to set when `create_method` is `POST`.
- `write_only_attrs` (List of String) A list of paths (in [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md)) to the attributes that are only settable, but won't be read in GET response.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the Resource. Same as the `path` when the `create_method` is `PUT`.
- `output` (String) The response body after reading the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--poll_create"></a>
### Nested Schema for `poll_create`

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second.
- `status` (Attributes) The expected status sentinels for each polling state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_create--status))
- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `<scope>[<path>]`, where `<scope>` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `<path>` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
- `url_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the polling url. The format is as `<k>[<v>]`, which can be one of `header[path]` (use the property at `path` in response header), `body[path]` (use the property at `path` in response body) or `exact[value]` (use the exact `value`). When absent, the resource's path is used for polling.

<a id="nestedatt--poll_create--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `poll_create.status`

Optional:

- `pending` (List of String) The expected status sentinels for pending status.
- `success` (String) The expected status sentinel for suceess status.



<a id="nestedatt--poll_delete"></a>
### Nested Schema for `poll_delete`

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second.
- `status` (Attributes) The expected status sentinels for each polling state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_delete--status))
- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `<scope>[<path>]`, where `<scope>` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `<path>` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
- `url_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the polling url. The format is as `<k>[<v>]`, which can be one of `header[path]` (use the property at `path` in response header), `body[path]` (use the property at `path` in response body) or `exact[value]` (use the exact `value`). When absent, the resource's path is used for polling.

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The import spec consists of following keys:
#
# - id (Required)               : The resource id.
# - query (Optional)            : The query parameters.
# - create_method (Optional)    : The import process needs to determine the resource's `path`, which is derived from manipulation on the `id`, based on whether `create_method` is `PUT` or `POST`.
#                                 This is only needed when current configured `create_method` is not as expected, i.e. if you have configured the `create_method` in the provider block, then this is
#                                 not needed to set here.
# - body (Optional)             : The interested properties in the response body that you want to manage via this resource. If you omit this, then all the properties will be keeping track, which in 
#                                 most cases is not what you want (e.g. the read only attributes shouldn't be managed).
#                                 The value of each property is not important here, hence leave them as `null`.

  "id": "/subscriptions/0-0-0-0/resourceGroups/example",
  "query": {"api-version": ["2020-06-01"]},
